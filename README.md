### Project Description:
This assignment uses jQuery, AJAX methods, and an API (with key) to generate a response according to the JSON data that returns from a third party server. When prompted, the movie application provides a user with movie information such as movie title, release date, original language, and popularity rating.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is an application that allows developers to interact with server-side data (database, APIs) without needing to pause any script or reload the webpage. AJAX relies on programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and data interchange format (XML/JSON). AJAX is based on four open standards: 1) Browser-based presentation using HTML and CSS, 2) XML format stores data once fetched from the server, 3) XMLHttpRequest objects fetches data, and 4) JavaScript runs the application to make everything work. AJAX allows for the creation of faster, interactive web applications with dynamic content display.

2. JavaScript Object Notation and XML (JSON) is an extension of JavaScript - it's the lightweight text-based syntax used for storing and exchanging data between web applications and servers. Essentially, it's used to make data exchanges "human readable." JSON is language independent, so no restructuring is required. JSON data comes in name/value pairs, each name in double quotes, separated by a colon. Data types include: Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object, Value, and Null. Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data. 

3. AJAX is known as being data-driven, not page-driven; however, not all servers support data requests. Developers can use proxy servers and web services to perform requests that would otherwise not be supported. A proxy server acts or performs requests for other clients and servers. A web service makes data available on one domain for use by other domains across the web. Web services often require API keys to grant data access to each person or organization that wants access. Still, AJAX is growing quickly, meaning it's complexity has increased. Without proper standardization (design patterns and best practice uses), AJAX-based applications will continue to be difficult to debug, test, and maintain. Hopefully, future toolkits and frameworks, especially the standardization of the XMLHttpRequest object, will address these issues.
